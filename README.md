<b>Rationale</b>

This project aims to develop an interactive website to support the <b>Thai Bee Workshop</b> in July 2025, hosted by the Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Natural History Museum (PSUNHM) in collaboration with the Bee and Spider Research Unit (BSRU) at Chulalongkorn University. Acting as a “dictionary,” the site will let users search for and navigate through specialized terminology in Thai bee research.

Long story short, we drew inspiration from the long-running U.S. Bee Course since 1999, to the present in 2025 which led by the B. Danforth team. Here, Natapot Warrit, Thai bee researcher mentored by the late Charles D. Michener, also attended to that course back in his US life. Now he is working in Thailand and led the BSRU (Thailand). Hence, we think it is a good opportunity to brings its proven idea to Southeast Asia, starting here in Thailand where we stationed to presents a unique opportunity for researchers and participants across the region. This effort is also supported by GBIF grant BIFA5-005 and PSUNHM.

The project will be structured and implemented by the Bee and Spider Research Unit, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University (Thailand).
